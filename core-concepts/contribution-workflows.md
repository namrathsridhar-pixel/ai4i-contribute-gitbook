# Contribution Workflows

AI4I-Contribute standardizes contribution workflows through four primary modes:

* **Suno (Listen)** – Speech validation and audio review
* **Bolo (Speak)** – Voice recording and speech contribution
* **Likho (Write)** – Text contribution, transcription, translation, OCR correction
* **Dekho (See)** – Image and video annotation

These workflows are designed to support large-scale public participation as well as expert-driven annotation.
