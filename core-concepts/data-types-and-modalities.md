# Data Types and Modalities

AI4I-Contribute supports multi-modal data ingestion, including:

* Speech (ASR, TTS datasets)
* Text (translation, transcription, NLP corpora)
* Images (OCR, object detection, labeling)
* Video (gesture, multimodal reasoning)
* Combined multimodal datasets

This flexibility allows Contribute to support both traditional NLP pipelines and emerging multimodal AI systems.
