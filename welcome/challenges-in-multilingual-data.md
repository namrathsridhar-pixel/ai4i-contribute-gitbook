# Challenges in Multilingual Data

Multilingual data collection faces several systemic challenges:

* Fragmented and ad-hoc data collection tools
* Lack of representative datasets for low-resource languages
* Difficulty scaling annotation and validation workflows
* Inconsistent metadata and labeling standards
* Limited international interoperability
* Complex challenges such as code-mixing, dialect variation, and cultural nuance

These challenges make it difficult for governments, institutions, and enterprises to build sustainable and inclusive Language AI systems without a shared data infrastructure.
