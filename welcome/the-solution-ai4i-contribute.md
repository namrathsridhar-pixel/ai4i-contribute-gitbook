# The Solution: AI4I-Contribute

AI4I-Contribute provides a unified, end-to-end building block for:

* Data ingestion
* Data annotation and enrichment
* Quality assurance and validation
* Governed and privacy-safe data management

It supports multiple participation models including citizen crowdsourcing, field-based collection, closed-group institutional annotation, and enterprise dataset creation.

Rather than being a standalone application, Contribute functions as foundational infrastructure for national and global Language AI ecosystems.
